# weather-prediction
Weather Prediction Project: This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts weather conditions in Seattle using historical data from seattle-weather.csv. It includes model training, evaluation, and saves the best model as model.pkl. The workflow is implemented in a Google Colab notebook.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- pickle

You can install the necessary packages using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-prediction.git
cd weather-prediction

2. Open the Google Colab notebook:

Upload weather-prediction.ipynb to Google Colab and run the cells to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train models, perform hyperparameter tuning, and evaluate them. The best model will be saved as model.pkl.

Example Prediction
The notebook includes an example prediction section where you can modify input data to test different predictions.
